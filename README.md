#Week 3 - BlackJack Project
##This is Moses Lee's weekend project for week 3.

*focus on OO Class Structure
I am going to start off with a UML.

I tried to think about each class, piece by piece, before making my Main GameTest class. In total, I ended up creating 6 classes and 3 enums. I had fun creating the enums, one for Suits, one for the Ranks, and one for the actual card value.
